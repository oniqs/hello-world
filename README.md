# hello-world

I`m oniqs, and this is my hello-world project.
As I`ve just started taking my first steps in web-developement, my aim is to become a professional Full Stack Developer!
I want to master the basics and front-end development first, gradually making my way to server-side web-development.
All visitors are welcome, have a great time ! ^_^
